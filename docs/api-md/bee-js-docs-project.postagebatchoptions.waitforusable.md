## PostageBatchOptions.waitForUsable property

The returned Promise will await until the purchased Postage Batch is usable. In other word, it has to have enough block confirmations that Bee pronounce it usable. When turned on, this significantly prolongs the creation of postage batch!

If you plan to use the stamp right away for some action with Bee (like uploading using this stamp) it is highly recommended to use this option, otherwise you might get errors "stamp not usable" from Bee.
