## Bee.pssReceive() method

Receive message with Postal Service for Swarm

Because sending a PSS message is slow and CPU intensive, it is not supposed to be used for general messaging but most likely for setting up an encrypted communication channel by sending an one-off message.

This is a helper function to wait for exactly one message to arrive and then cancel the subscription. Additionally a timeout can be provided for the message to arrive or else an error will be thrown.

\*\*Warning! If connected Bee node is a light node, then he will never receive any message!\*\* This is because light nodes does not fully participate in the data exchange in Swarm network and hence the message won't arrive to them.

**Signature:**

```typescript
pssReceive(topic: Topic, timeoutMsec?: number): Promise<Bytes>;
```
