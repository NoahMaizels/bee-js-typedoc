## PostageBatch.utilization property

Represents how much of the batch is used up.

Max utilization = `2 ** (depth - bucketDepth)`

Since the smallest depth is 17, and one batch has 65,536 buckets, and one chunk is 4,096 bytes, the 512MB theoretical max size for the smallest stamp comes from `2 * 65536 * 4096 = 512MB`

**Signature:**

```typescript
utilization: number;
```
